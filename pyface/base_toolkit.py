""" A basic toolkit implementation for use by specific toolkits

Writers of toolkit plugins are expected to provide a callable object which
takes a relative module path and an object name, separated by a colon.  The
assumption is that this is implemented by objects in sub-modules of the
toolkit, but plugin authors are free to use whatever methods they like.
